## Installation

1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/ultrastar-web-server.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ultrastar-web-server`
4. Run `poetry install` to install all dependencies.

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following variables:

   ```
   QR_URL=http://your_local_ip_address:5000
   SONGFOLDER=path_to_your_songs_directory
   SONG_DB=sqlite:///path_to_your_songs.db_file
   ULTRASTAR_DB=sqlite:///path_to_your_ultrastar_database_file
   ```
